# osYou
**_a personal operating system_**

**What this is**

This repository contains the early design and implementation of osYou, a personal operating system focused on reducing cognitive load, context-switching, and work-related confusion for solo knowledge workers.

**Who it's for**

This system is designed primarily for experienced writers and editors managing complex, overlapping projects.

**Problem this solves**

The goal is to help users complete work faster by preserving context, minimizing tool-switching, and making it easy to stop and resume work without mental reconstruction.

**What this isn't**

This is not a team collaboration tool, a productivity methodology, or a creativity enhancer.

**Current status**
