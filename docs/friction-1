Tasks going astray
Tasks are scattered across the desktop, a notepad, the brain and several post-its stuck to the screen.

When this happens
Beginning of the day, when you're trying to figure out what task to tackle first.
Midday, when you are trying to find a stopping point for a short break.
End of day, when you are trying to find a stopping point for the evening.
Anytime a new message pops up on Teams, Basecamp, email, or Slack and it's something you have to handle because it's "quick question," or "do you have a sec?"
Right after a meeting when tasks have been distributed while you were multitasking anyway.
Near a deadline, when you're trying to deflect all distractions for a while but they keep coming.
When the phone rings. Concentration = broken.

Why it’s a problem
Your concentration is broken and you momentarily can't remember where you were, and when you do, you can't decide if what you were doing is more important to finish than the next urgent task is to start.

What “better” looks like
The same number of tasks coming at you one at a time, like evenly spaced tennis balls. You could hit each one amazingly if given the chance to take a proper swing.
