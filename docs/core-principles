#**OSYou / OSDone – Core Principles**

#Work like a human

This system is designed around how humans actually work: with limited attention, frequent interruptions, and a need for clean stopping points. It removes friction instead of demanding optimization.
This system helps you do more so you can be done.
Doing more is valuable only when it enables completion. Completion is a real state, and being done is success.

#Efficiency creates time to play
Efficiency at work is successful only when it creates time to play. Play is any time chosen freely, without obligation or productivity pressure.

#Explanations (optional) are always available
One click explains what each thing is in normal user language.

#Finish beats busy
Visible, auditable completion matters more than constant activity. The system prioritizes finishing work clearly enough that trust is preserved without performative effort.

#Think it through
Thinking is real work. This system protects time and space for deep thinking before action, response, or commitment. Speed that bypasses understanding is failure, not efficiency.

#Useful is up to the user
If the user doesn't find it useful, it needs to adapt (or be switched off).

#Winning work is not the goal
Most systems are built to help you win more work. This system is built to help you finish work and leave it behind.

#Guardrails
	•	If a feature increases output but makes it harder to stop, it does not belong.
	•	If a feature rewards availability instead of completion, it does not belong.
	•	If a feature adds friction disguised as control, it does not belong.

#List guardrails
Lists are critical to work, and the order of items in a list makes it more useful or less useful.
	•	The default order is user-controlled and stable. OSYou will not make decisions about this.
	•	No sorting by ID, ever. IDs should remain invisible.
	•	No sorting by task text/title unless the user explicitly chooses a “Sort A–Z” or some other text-dependent view.
	•	Renaming or editing a task must never change its position.
	•	New tasks land at the end (or top) of lists consistently, by design.

#Status
These principles guide all future design decisions. They are intentionally restrictive.
