#**OSYou / OSDone – Core Principles**

#Work like a human

This system is designed around how humans actually work: with limited attention, frequent interruptions, and a need for clean stopping points. It removes friction instead of demanding optimization.
This system helps you do more so you can be done
Doing more is valuable only when it enables completion. Completion is a real state, and being done is success.

#Efficiency creates time to play
Efficiency at work is successful only when it creates time to play. Play is any time chosen freely, without obligation or productivity pressure.

#Finish beats busy
Visible, auditable completion matters more than constant activity. The system prioritizes finishing work clearly enough that trust is preserved without performative effort.

#Think it through
Thinking is real work. This system protects time and space for deep thinking before action, response, or commitment. Speed that bypasses understanding is failure, not efficiency.

#Winning work is not the goal
Most systems are built to help you win more work. This system is built to help you finish work and leave it behind.

#Guardrails
	•	If a feature increases output but makes it harder to stop, it does not belong.
	•	If a feature rewards availability instead of completion, it does not belong.
	•	If a feature adds friction disguised as control, it does not belong.

#Status
These principles guide all future design decisions. They are intentionally restrictive.
